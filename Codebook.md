###Data Set Information:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING-UPSTAIRS, WALKING-DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.  

**There are four columns in the tidy data table.**  

1. Subject  
2. ActivityName  
3. Mx Name  
4. Value  
  
###Subject  
There are 30 subjects who participated in the experiment so to identify measurements related to each, I have given each number 1 to 30.

###ActivityName
There are 6 activities that were performed by each subject. 

1. WALKING  
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  
4. SITTING  
5. STANDING  
6. LAYING   
  
###Mx Name
This column describes the type of measurement taken during the experiment for a subject doing an activity.  

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAccelerometer and timeGyroscope. These time domain signals (prefix 'time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
and the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAccelerometer and timeGravityAccelerometer) both using a low pass Butterworth filter.  

The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerometerJerk and timeBodyGyroscopeJerk). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitude, timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitude, timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude,
 timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude).

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAccelerometer, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk, frequencyBodyGyroscope, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitude,
 frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude.

**Description of abbreviations of measurements**  

leading "time" or "frequency" is based on time or frequency measurements.  
Body = related to body movement.  
Gravity = acceleration of gravity  
Accelerometer = accelerometer measurement  
Gyroscope = gyroscopic measurements  
Jerk = sudden movement acceleration  
Magnitude = magnitude of movement  
mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and Standard Deviation measurements.  

The units given are gâ€™s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyroscope and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.
